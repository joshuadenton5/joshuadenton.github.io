                <h1>Personal Profile</h1>
                <p id="profile">As a recent graduate with a 1st in Computer Gaming Technology, I am looking to utilise the skills I have acquired to contribute to an ambitious, game development studio. 
                I believe that the exposure I have had to highly regarded game engines, alongside the experience I posess with object orientated programming languages, will prepare me for a role within this challenging industry. 
                My career goal is to take a position that allows me to take responsibility for implementing interesting gameplay mechanics together with learning as much as possible along the way.  
                </p>
