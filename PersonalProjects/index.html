                        In <i>Cooking With Polygons</i>,
                        you are in charge of preparing meals in a busy restaurant kitchen, although you are the only chef.
                        Earn money by creating top quality meals for the ever picky customers. Expect your work to be scrutinised and
                        get rewarded handsomely for your endeavors.
                        After earning enough money, you can upgrade your status by learning new recipes to add to your restaurant's menu. <br /><br />
                        Initially a university project, I decided to keeping updating this game. I am the sole developer, responsible for
                        developing most of the assets (including the models - basic I know). This is certainly the project I have put
                        the most time and energy into.

                        <i>Ball-Drop</i> is a fast paced ball rolling maze game where your objective is to solve mazes within a time limit.
                        Each maze is procedurally generated, keeping the player on their toes. Points are accumulated by completing mazes and 
                        collecting drops.
