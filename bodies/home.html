                My name is Josh Denton and welcome to my Development portfolio. I'm currently employed at <a href= "https://https://invinciblesstudio.com//">Invincibles Studio</a> and based in Leeds, UK.
                <br>
                Working in a team of other developers and desingers, we're currently working on a multiplayer online football game, developed in Unity and C# for Android and iOS platforms.

                Throughout my time at Invincibles Studio, I've engaged in various projects and repositories, spanning from implementing UI designs to working with compelling 3D animations. 
                I've leveraged Unity's Addressables asset system to dynamically fetch remote content during runtime, in addition to undertaking demanding refactoring tasks. 
                Undoubtedly, my time here has equipped me with a diverse skill set, serving as a robust foundation for future endeavors.
