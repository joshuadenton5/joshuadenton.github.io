                    you are in charge of preparing meals in a busy restaurant kitchen, although you are the only chef.

                    get rewarded handsomely for your endeavors.

                    Initially a university project, I decided to keeping updating this game. I am the sole developer, responsible for
                    developing most of the assets (including the models - basic I know). This is certainly the project I have put
                    the most time and energy into.

                    <i>Ball-Drop</i> is a fast paced ball rolling maze game where your objective is to solve an endless run of procedurally generated mazes against the clock.
                    Points are accumulated by completing mazes and collecting drops. The main input comes from accessing the devices accelerometer allowing the ball to roll when the device is tilted.
                    Where an accelerometer is not available, input is recorded via keyboard.
