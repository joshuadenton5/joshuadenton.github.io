                    Initially a university project, I decided to keeping updating this game. I am the sole developer, responsible for
                    developing most of the assets (including the models - basic I know). This is certainly the project I have put
                    the most time and energy into. This game was built using Unity and C#.
                    <br /> <br />
                    Looking back at this project, the main challenge came with designing and implementing how the player would interact with
                    objects in the environment. I went from creating a system using inheritance but this became far too convoluted and thus was
                    scrapped. I decided to design an interface, of which all interactable objects in the game implemented. This made the code far easier
                    to follow as well as creating freedom when dictating the behaviour of specific objects.
                    <br />
                    I currently have a project in the works (very early) that is looking to further improve upon the interact system. At the moment,
                    both an inheritance and interface are implemented.

                    <i>Ball-Drop</i> is a fast paced ball rolling maze game where your objective is to solve an endless run of procedurally generated mazes against the clock.
                    Points are accumulated by completing mazes and collecting drops. The main input comes from accessing the devices accelerometer allowing the ball to roll when the device is tilted.
                    Where an accelerometer is not available, input is recorded via keyboard.
