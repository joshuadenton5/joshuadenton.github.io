                    Initially a university project, I decided to keeping updating this game. I am the sole developer, responsible for
                    developing most of the assets (including the models - basic I know). This is certainly the project I have put
                    the most time and energy into. This game was built using Unity and C#.

                    Looking back at this project, the main challenge came with designing and implementing how the player would interact with
                    objects in the environment. I went from creating a system using inheritance but this became far too convoluted and thus was
                    scrapped. I decided to design an interface, of which all interactable objects in the game implemented. This made the code far easier
                    to follow as well as creating more freedom when dictating the behaviour of specific objects.
                    <br /><br />

                            public Interface IInteract() //declaring the interface<br />
                            { <br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OnLeftMouseButton(); <br />
                            }

                            {<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public void OnLeftMouseButton() //implement different logic for each class<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//code logic here <br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
                            }

                    <br /><br />
                    I currently have a project in the works (very early) that is looking to further improve upon the interact system. At the moment,
                    both an inheritance and interface are implemented.
                    <br /><br />
                    I still feel that this game can be further improved upon and would it would be great to get some further feedback from playtesting to resolve
                    some balancing issues that have been reported.

                    Developing this website has been a thoroughly enjoyable experience, and something I have put a fair amount of time
                    and energy into recently. The link above will take you to the github repository which is where this website is hosted.
                    Building this website has further improved my HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge, as well as exposing me to new frameworks like
                    Jquery and Ajax. I know I still have plenty to learn, but this has been a great experience from the start and something I'd love
                    to keep developing - (hopefully as I get more experiences and projects to add!). Any feedback on this website would be greatly appreciated. <br /><br />

                    <i>Ball-Drop</i> is a fast paced ball rolling maze game where your objective is to solve an endless run of procedurally generated mazes against the clock.
                    Points are accumulated by completing mazes and collecting drops. The main input comes from accessing the devices accelerometer allowing the ball to roll when the device is tilted.
                    Where an accelerometer is not available, input is recorded via keyboard. <br /><br />

                    The player has the option to utilise a feature that will show the route to solving the maze though this can only be used three times
                    in one session.<br />

                    Going back over this project now and looking at how the mechanics were implemented, I feel like much could be improved upon.
                    In terms of readability, many of the main functions and methods could have separated out into either new classes or structs. This
                    certainly would have been helpful for the <i>Game Manager</i> script where it's unorganised and packed with far to many variables and
                    functions for my liking. Looking ahead, my next project will aim to keep the scripts and code as concise and readable as possible.
