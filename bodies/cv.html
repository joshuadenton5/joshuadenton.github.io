            <h1>Personal Profile</h1>
            <p id="profile">
                <!--- As a recent graduate with a 1st in Computer Gaming Technology, I am looking to utilise the skills I have acquired within an ambitious, forward thinking software company.
    I have proven practical ability to develop software as well as a key understanding of object orientated design principles. Although I have primarily been taught to develop games,
    I feel that these skills are transferrable areas of software development and I am keen to broaden my skillset. I also have experience programming on open source e-commerce services.

                As a recent graduate with a 1st in Computer Gaming Technology, I am looking to utilise the skills I have acquired to contribute to an ambitious, game development studio.
                I believe that the exposure I have had to highly regarded game engines, alongside the experience I possess with object orientated programming languages, will prepare me for a role within this challenging industry.
                As for future prospects, I would love to be working as a senior developer with knowledge of multiple engines and programming languages.
